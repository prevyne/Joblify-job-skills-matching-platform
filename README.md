The Joblify job-skills matching platform

This document summarizes the key features implemented in the Joblify platform and the development plan.

I. Project Goal:
To develop "Joblify," an AI-powered job-skills matching platform aimed at addressing unemployment in Kenya, with an initial focus on tech skills.

II. Successfully Implemented Features:

A. Core Platform & Setup:

Django project ("Joblify") initialized with apps: profiles (for job seekers), jobs (for job postings), and employers.

Database models defined and migrated for:

Skill (profiles app)

UserProfile (profiles app) - linked to Django's User

Company (jobs app)

JobPosting (jobs app) - linked to Company and Skill

EmployerProfile (employers app) - linked to User and Company

JobApplication (profiles app) - links UserProfile to JobPosting, includes application_date and status (with choices like 'submitted', 'viewed', 'shortlisted', 'rejected_by_employer', 'withdrawn_by_applicant', 'hired').

Django Admin interface configured for managing these models.

Basic UI styling implemented using Bootstrap 5 (via CDN in base.html).

B. Job Seeker Functionality:

User Authentication:

Signup (creating User and UserProfile, adding to "JobSeekers" group).

Login & Logout.

Role-based redirection after login (job seekers to job list).

Profile Management:

View own profile (profile_detail.html).

Edit own profile (profile_edit.html), including bio, picture, contact info, and skills.

Job Interaction:

View list of active job postings (jobposting_list.html) with basic keyword search.

View detailed information for a specific job posting (jobposting_detail.html).

Apply for Jobs:

"Apply Now" functionality on job detail page.

Creates JobApplication record.

Allows re-application if a previous application was 'withdrawn_by_applicant' or 'rejected_by_employer' (logic implemented in apply_for_job view - as per apply_for_job_view_reapply_logic_001).

job_detail view updated to correctly show "Apply Now" button for re-application scenarios.

My Applications Page:

View a paginated list of submitted applications (my_applications.html).

View the status of each application (as updated by employers).

Withdraw Application: Functionality to withdraw an application, changing its status.

C. Employer Functionality:

User Authentication & Setup:

Employer Signup (creating User, Company if new, EmployerProfile, adding to "Employers" group).

Login & Logout.

Role-based redirection after login (employers to employer dashboard).

Dashboard & Profile Management:

Employer Dashboard (employer_dashboard.html) showing company overview, job summary, and links to actions.

Edit Company Profile (edit_company_profile.html) for details like name, description, logo, website, location.

Job Management:

Post New Job (create_job_posting.html) - form based on JobPosting model.

Edit Existing Job Postings (edit_job_posting.html).

Activate/Deactivate Job Postings (toggle is_active status) from dashboard/manage page.

"Manage All Jobs" page (manage_jobs_list.html) with a paginated list of all company's job postings and management actions.

Applicant Management:

View Applicants: Page (view_job_applicants.html) listing applicants for a specific job, with pagination.

Includes filtering by application status and sorting (by application date, applicant name).

View Applicant Profile: Employers can view the detailed profile of an applicant (applicant_profile_display.html) in a read-only format.

Update Application Status: Employers can change the status of applications (e.g., "Viewed," "Shortlisted") from the "View Applicants" page.

III. Main Primary Development Plan (Agreed Order of Next Steps):

We had established the following order for upcoming features, prioritizing a favorable end-user environment before diving deep into the AI engine:

Job Seeker: Withdraw Application - (Successfully Implemented)

Employer: Further Applicant Filtering/Sorting on "View Applicants" page - (Successfully Implemented)

Notifications (Basic):

For Job Seekers:

Application Submitted Confirmation.

Application Status Change notifications.

For Employers:

New Application Received notification.

Conceptualize AI Matching Core:

Discuss techniques (NLP, similarity measures, ML).

Skill representation and weighting.

Match score calculation and presentation.

Data requirements.

"Courses" and "Community" Features: (From initial dashboard mockup, to be detailed later).

Dual Role Capability (Phase 2): Allow a single user account to toggle between Job Seeker and Employer views/profiles, setting up alternate profiles at will, with notifications specific to the active role.

IV. Current Context (Point to Resume From in New Chat):
We have just successfully implemented and tested:

Job seeker re-application logic.

Job seeker viewing application statuses.

Employer filtering and sorting of applicants.

Employer ability to view applicant profiles.

Employer ability to update application statuses.

The next item on my agreed plan is to start working on Basic Notifications. I chosestarting with the "Application Submitted Confirmation" email for job seekers.
